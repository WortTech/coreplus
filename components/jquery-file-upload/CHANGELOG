jQuery-File-Upload 6.9.1~core3

	* Switched default upload method from POST to stream.  This allows for much larger files
	to be uploaded at a time, (tested with a couple 1.7GB videos).  The browser will chunk up to
	"ini_get('upload_max_filesize')" bytes at a time and upload pieces.

jQuery-File-Upload 6.9.1~core2

	* Set files to be auto uploaded by default
	* Rearranged the UI slightly
	* Updated the progress bar
