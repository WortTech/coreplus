# Sync From Upstream script

If you have a checkout of an upstream version of Core, you can use this script to import that directly into this project.

## Ignored Files

If you are syncing a component, you can add a file in the root of your component called `.upstreamignore`.
This file should have a list of files to be ignored, (relative to itself), each on one line.
