<!--
	Theme is the main container for everything for a given... well, theme.
	It's the root node, and each theme can only contain one theme.xml, which contains only one theme directive.

	The theme directive MUST have a name and version attribute.
	The name MUST match the theme's directory, (capitalization is optional).
	The version SHOULD start with a number, and ideally have minor and point revisions, optionally with a third party flag at the end.
