    An example how to use this DTD from your XML document:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
	<!DOCTYPE component SYSTEM "http://corepl.us/api/2_4/package.dtd">

    <package>
    ...
    </package>
-->

<!--
	The package directive.

	Each package directive must have:
	1 description

	And each package will probably have at least one of the following:
	* provides
	* requires
	* upgrade

	And may have:
	1 location
-->
<!ELEMENT package (description|(provide|require|upgrade*)|location?) >
<!ATTLIST package
	type (component|theme) #REQUIRED
	name CDATA #REQUIRED
	version CDATA #REQUIRED
	packager CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--
	NOTE, as a self-contained package, there is no location unlike when merged into the repo.
	This is because "location" would be itself, since it's enclosed in the tarball!

	HOWEVER, since the PackageXML class is still used for repo-based package data, allow it as an optional field.
