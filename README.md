# About

Core Plus is a PHP-based web framework written to be fast, secure and scalable.  Ultimately, I created this framework
because there were certain quirks with other frameworks and systems that I was not completely satisfied with.

For more info, checkout the [Core Plus project site](http://corepl.us)


# Licenses

The core framework is licensed under the AGPLv3.  Included libraries are a variety of other open licenses, such as
