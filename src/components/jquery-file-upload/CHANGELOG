jQuery-File-Upload 6.9.1~core4

	* [Bug] Fix in IE for uploading files.  That browser did not support json data returned, so it was
	  instead trying to download the recently uploaded file.  (Yeah, bizarre...)

jQuery-File-Upload 6.9.1~core3

	* Switched default upload method from POST to stream.  This allows for much larger files to be
	  uploaded at a time, (tested with a couple 1.7GB videos).  The browser will chunk up to
	  "ini_get('upload_max_filesize')" bytes at a time and upload pieces.
	* Switched the key name that tracks the files from "key" to "uploadkey".  This should help resolve the
	  weird random upload issues that have been experienced.
