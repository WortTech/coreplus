Nonce 1.0.1

	* Nonce models now encrypt the stored data associated with a given key.  This allows more sensitive
	  information to be stored.
	* Nonce data is now being serialized.  This means that a raw object or array can be directly passed
	  into the set or Generate methods.  This object is also unserialized automatically, so the reverse
	  methods can be called directly.
