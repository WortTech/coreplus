	The favicon is an image that is used to represent your site in browsers, desktop shortcuts, and mobile icons.
	It is the only icon that appears to users when your site is not active, so branding on this element is critical!
	<br/><br/>
	An ideal image to use is a square PNG at least <strong>228x228</strong> pixels in size.
	<br/><br/>
	Under "Advanced", you can upload custom images for each common size used by devices.
	This allows the 16x16 favicon to be a tiny pixel-art image while 
	the mobile devices get a pretty 140x140 PNG with rounded edges, gradients, and the works.
