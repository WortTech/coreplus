<h1>Requested Range Not Satisfiable</h1>

<p class="message-error">
	A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a request included a Range request-header field
	(section 14.35), and none of the range-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent of the selected resource,
	and the request did not include an If-Range request-header field.
