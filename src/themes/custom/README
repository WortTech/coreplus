The "custom" directory is not a theme, but a location for user-script to install overwritten stylesheets, assets, and templates into.
This is to accommodate the new (2.5.4), feature of users being able to install and manage their site assets.

There are no meta files here, just the raw files themselves.

! IMPORTANT ! If you're a developer and you're looking here... DON'T!  This is a dynamic directory meant for files
modified from within the UI of the application.  It provides a location for your client to edit your custom theme
and asset resources, without actually changing your theme and resources.
