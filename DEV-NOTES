I changed the structure of the user table some.  If you're updating, please run the following sql:

ALTER TABLE `CAE2_user` CHANGE `uid` `id` INT( 15 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;

This is because the system doesn't gracefully handle renaming columns yet, let alone primary keys.
@todo Decide if this issue merits time to solve.
