===============
Misc bug fixes and minor improvements. See below:

Changelog:

 - mysql: Fixed GetOne() to return null if no records returned.
 - oci8 perf: added stats on sga, rman, memory usage, and flash in performance tab.
 - odbtp: Now you can define password in $password field of Connect()/PConnect(), and it will add it to DSN.
 - Datadict: altering columns did not consider the scale of the column. Now it does.
 - mssql: Fixed problem with ADODB_CASE_ASSOC causing multiple versions of column name appearing in recordset fields.
 - oci8: Added missing & to refLob.
 - oci8: Added obj->scale to FetchField().
 - oci8: Now you can get column info of a table in a different schema, e.g. MetaColumns("schema.table") is supported.
 - odbc_mssql: Fixed missing $metaDatabasesSQL.
 - xmlschema: Changed declaration of create() to create($xmls) to fix compat problems. Also changed constructor adoSchema() to pass in variable instead of variable reference.
 - ado5: Fixed ado5 exceptions to only display errors when $this->debug=true;
 - Added DSN support to sessions2.inc.php.
 - adodb-lib.inc.php. Fixed issue with _adodb_getcount() not using $secs2cache parameter.
 - adodb active record. Fixed caching bug. See http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=18288.
 - db2: fixed ServerInfo().
 - adodb_date: Added support for format 'e' for TZ as in adodb_date('e')
 - Active Record: If you have a field which is a string field (with numbers in) and you add preceding 0's to it the adodb library does not pick up the fact that the field has changed because of the way php's == works (dodgily). The end result is that it never gets updated into the database - fix by  Matthew Forrester (MediaEquals). [matthew.forrester#mediaequals.com]
 - Fixes RowLock() and MetaIndexes() inconsistencies. See http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=18236
 - Active record support for postgrseql boolean. See http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=18246
 - By default, Execute 2D array is disabled for security reasons. Set $conn->bulkBind = true to enable. See http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=18270. Note this breaks backward compat.
 - MSSQL: fixes for 5.2 compat. http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=18325
 - Changed Version() to return a string instead of a float so it correctly returns 5.10 instead of 5.1.
